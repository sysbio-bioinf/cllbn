# CLL to Richter Syndrome: integrating network-based strategies with experimental readouts elucidating disease-drivers and personalized therapies

# Boolean network simulation and experimental data evaluation

The modeled Boolean network is given in the text-based BoolNet-format (CLL_Model.txt, CLL_Model_Microenvironment.txt). Experimental data on the patient cohort can be found in BMI1_Expression_Anonymous.csv and CD5_Expression_Anonymous.csv. Simulation, analysis and code for visualizing the results can be found in CLL_FigureScripts.R. The script is ordered according to the figure numbers in the draft. 

# Validation of CLL/Richter Boolean network using Single Cell RNA Seq data

Code for the validation of the Boolean network prediction based on single cell RNA sequencing data can be found in the RMarkdown file SingleCellAnalysis.Rmd. Intermediary results are given as RData-objects.
